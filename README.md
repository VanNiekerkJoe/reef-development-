# 🚀 Running the Prototype

A quick-start guide to get this app running locally — no configuration required, the `.env` values are already included.

## ✅ Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Node.js** v18+ | Check with `node -v` |
| **Package manager** | npm (bundled with Node), or yarn / pnpm / bun |

> 💡 The `.env` file already contains the required values — you don't need to create or edit anything.

---

## 1️⃣ Open a Terminal in the Project Folder

Navigate to the project root (the folder containing `package.json`):

```bash
cd path/to/project
```

---

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Pick whichever matches your setup:

<table>
<tr><th>Tool</th><th>Command</th></tr>
<tr><td>npm</td><td>

```bash
npm install
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>yarn</td><td>

```bash
yarn install
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>pnpm</td><td>

```bash
pnpm install
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>bun</td><td>

```bash
bun install
```

</td></tr>
</table>

---

## 3️⃣ Start the App

<table>
<tr><th>Tool</th><th>Command</th></tr>
<tr><td>npm</td><td>

```bash
npm run dev
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>yarn</td><td>

```bash
yarn dev
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>pnpm</td><td>

```bash
pnpm dev
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>bun</td><td>

```bash
bun run dev
```

</td></tr>
</table>

This runs the `dev` script defined in `package.json`, which launches the local **Vite** development server.

---

## 4️⃣ Open the App

Once the server starts, the terminal will print a local URL. By default, Vite runs at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

Open that address in your browser. 🎉

You'll land on the sign-in screen:

> 🔑 **For the lecturer:** No need to register or sign in manually — use the **Demo Access** buttons at the bottom of the screen (`OWNER DEMO` or `WORKER DEMO`) to jump straight into each role's view.

## 🛠️ If It Does Not Start

| Possible Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| Dependencies not installed | Re-run step 2 |
| Wrong folder | Run `pwd` and confirm `package.json` is present |
| `.env` missing or not loaded | Check the file exists in the project root |
| Port `5173` in use | Vite will auto-suggest the next free port — check the terminal output |
